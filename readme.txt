This readme serves as a short description of the game: 
Starting in the menu you have the option to chose if you want to go first, what size board you want and how many you want to be connecting.
Let's suppose you pick all the standard things, you go first, its a 6x7 board and you're connecting 4.
At the top of the screen a translucent version of your piece will appear where your cursor is located.
Left-click will drop to piece to the furthest open row at the column your mouse is at. Then the enemy plays and after that, the board transposes.
The goal of the game is to get 4 pieces in a row in any direction.
